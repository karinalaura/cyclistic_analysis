Capstone Project: Cyclistic Case Study

Introduction
I recently completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate offered on Coursera. As part of the course, I learned about the six stages of the data analysis process and how to use technical tools (SQL, Tableau, R) to get insights from large amounts of data. Google recommends completing a Capstone Project at the end of the course to demonstrate the technical skills and understanding of the data analysis process.Thus, I have completed my Capstone Project on the Cyclistic Case Study.

Background
In this case study, I am assuming the role of a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. They have two types of customers; Casual riders who purchase single-ride or full-day passes and Cyclistic members, customers who purchase annual memberships. Cyclisticâ€™s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. 
To complete this business task the team has assigned me the following question to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

Other info
The tecnhical tools I used during this project are R Studio and Tableau.
